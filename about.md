Hey I’m Ceara. My friends call me Pixie. I’m 24. I live in East London. I’m training to be a teacher.

In my spare time I like to eat food (especially PIZZA), wear trainers and explore new places.

This blog is an opportunity to show you where I go... be it around the world or little hidden gem in Town (London).

Come follow my life in stories and pictures.
