[Zealand Road Coffee Shop](https://www.facebook.com/zealandroadcoffeeshop), I love this cafe. It's small but has everything you need in a local coffee shop. I not saying this place is worth a venture out of central, but if you're in the area definitely drop in.

It has a short and simple menu, perfect for anyone like me who is terrible at making a decision. I love the avocado on toast with olive oil and chilli, this is the main reason I visit.

But everything is great... 

The coffee, the bacon butties with homemade ketchup, the constantly changing cake menu (but definitely try the pistachio and raspberry if you can!), the free wifi, the chilled vibe and of course friendly staff. 

This list can go on.

So if you're ever near Roman Road definitely drop in and prove me right!
