I booked in for a [Mac make up tutorial session](http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/) at [Westfields,](https://uk.westfield.com/london/stores/all-stores/mac/56229) Stratford and it was one of the best decisions I've made regarding the slap on my face. 

> Why do my eyebrows look like two slugs on my face, I was trying to be sharp and fierce!?

First of all, I'm already a big fan of Mac cosmetics, the products are high quality, they last me a long time and they don't crack or flake off my face half way through the day. Nobody has time for that...  But most importantly they have a sales assistants there to help you make the right choices, giving you advice if you don't have a clue... Yeah that's me. Hallo. 

So the reason I booked in was because I have make up and I use it daily (yup like most girls). Yet I feel unconfident applying it and end up looking in the mirror and think why do I look like that? Why do I have lines in my foundation, I used a jazzy brush? Why do my eyebrows look like two slugs on my face, I was trying to be sharp and fierce!? Why does my lipstick look like I've put I’ve applied it on the tube... I really tried this time,  I did, I swear!

Anyway the list goes on as you can imagine. So booking into MAC gave me opportunity to speak 1 to 1 with a make up artist and gain some well needs skills. 

> But the most important thing I learnt was...

I learnt a lot about make up, how to use it and why. I learnt that my eyebrows are really fair so I need an expresso shade, not a warm brown which makes my eyebrows look ginger.

I learnt that I'm awful at lipstick, I tried 3 times with the liner and Grace (the MA) had to sort me out. I learnt that when using blusher you do a 'c' shape on the side of your face. 

But the most important thing I learnt was PRACTISE! Make up application is a skill, and if you want to look like a sick bitch then you need to work for it. Just like most things ey!?

So I'm gunna spend a little more time on my technique and see how it goes!

If you need a little bit of a confident boost in the make up department, fancy a little treat or want to learn something new, I would definitely recommend this. 
It’s easy, you book in advance, pay a £50 deposit which goes towards your new make up, yo turn up and voila!
