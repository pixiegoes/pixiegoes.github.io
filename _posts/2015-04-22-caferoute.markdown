> an array of colourful, inventive and **mouth watering** salads.

On my tragic two bus, traffic fuelled journey to work I would always look forward to my morning coffee. And that would be my stop off at [Cafe Route](http://www.caferoute.co.uk/). A perfect skinny cappuccino (made with [MONMOUTH Coffee](http://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/)), friendly staff and the delicious looking cakes I would pine over as I waited. It was a great way to start my day.

So when I introduced to Cafe Route’s new summer menu I was very intrigued to see what they had to offer.

I booked in for a lunch date with my sister. It was Friday afternoon and it was buzzing. As you walked in you were greeted with an array of colourful, inventive and **mouth watering** salads. I wanted them all.

To start we ordered some paprika olives. Plump, juicy and full of flavour. Accompanied by a couple of glasses of wine, I went for the Organic Italian White while [Esmee](https://www.instagram.com/esmee_gummer/) went for her true love, Savvy Blancy. They were both perfect for a Friday afternoon catch up and we could have easily have stayed a lot longer with a bottle or 3.

So lets get down to my favourite part. 

The lunch menu works by ordering a main dish and selecting either 2 or 3 salads. You have the choice of sandwiches, soup and tasty looking burgers too. But after being greeted by that salad at the door there was no chance I was changing my mind. I chose the *Sweet potato served with Pulled Lamb* and picked the *Tabbouleh* and *Peach with feta cheese, finely chopped chilli and pomegranate molasses*.

Even writing about it now I’m salivating. The lamb was amazing, it melted in my mouth. I have no clue how they made pulled lamb but they made it well. The tabbouleh was fresh and well balanced. I loved the peach and feta too, the two foods worked well together. It could have done with a few more pomegranate molasses but that is probably because **I LOVE THEM.** 

Esmee went for the *Sweet chilli glazed salmon fillet..* It’s served cold so it’s perfect if you want that light, summer lunch vibe. She picked *Sweet Potato & Chick Peas with Tahini drizzle* and *Aubergine Almond Bulgur with Pomegranate Salsa*. We swapped half way through (as we like to do that) and again I was very impressed with the quality and flavour of the salads.

> It tasted so good, you felt like you were being naughty

What I enjoyed most about the lunch menu was that the salad options were unique, light, fresh, amazing in flavours and textures and but most importantly they were **healthy!** It tasted so good, you felt like you were being naughty. It’s the best type of over-indulging. **FACT.** They’re very considerate of allergens too offering **gluten free,** **nut free** and **dairy free.** options in their salads. I would highly recommend this place if you’re looking for a nice, light lunch that is flavoursome and apetizing.

> and a wall full of wine. My kinda place.

I love the decor too. I’m going to describe it as industrial, rustic chic. Dried meat and paprika hanging over the deli counter and a open kitchen so you can see the chefs in action. My fav part was the wall full of wine. It had the quote *‘the first kiss and the first glass of wine are the best’*. My kind of place.

Sadly, I have changed jobs so I will not be stopping off at Cafe Route anymore for my morning pick me up. But after this visit I will definitely be returning with friends to explore more of the menu. Try it, you won’t regret it!
