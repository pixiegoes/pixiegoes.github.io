    <blockquote>
  <p>an array of colourful, inventive and <strong>mouth watering</strong> salads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On my tragic two bus, traffic fuelled journey to work I would always look forward to my morning coffee. And that would be my stop off at <a href="http://www.caferoute.co.uk/">Cafe Route</a>. A perfect skinny cappuccino (made with <a href="http://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/">MONMOUTH Coffee</a>), friendly staff and the delicious looking cakes I would pine over as I waited. It was a great way to start my day.</p>

<p>So when I introduced to Cafe Route’s new summer menu I was very intrigued to see what they had to offer.</p>

<p>I booked in for a lunch date with my sister. It was Friday afternoon and it was buzzing. As you walked in you were greeted with an array of colourful, inventive and <strong>mouth watering</strong> salads. I wanted them all.</p>
<figure class="full"><div class="post-content-img" style="background-image:url(/images/route/salad.jpg);"></div></figure>

<p>To start we ordered some paprika olives. Plump, juicy and full of flavour. Accompanied by a couple of glasses of wine, I went for the Organic Italian White while <a href="https://www.instagram.com/esmee_gummer/">Esmee</a> went for her true love, Savvy Blancy. They were both perfect for a Friday afternoon catch up and we could have easily have stayed a lot longer with a bottle or 3.</p>

<p>So lets get down to my favourite part.</p>

<p>The lunch menu works by ordering a main dish and selecting either 2 or 3 salads. You have the choice of sandwiches, soup and tasty looking burgers too. But after being greeted by that salad at the door there was no chance I was changing my mind. I chose the <em>Sweet potato served with Pulled Lamb</em> and picked the <em>Tabbouleh</em> and <em>Peach with feta cheese, finely chopped chilli and pomegranate molasses</em>.</p>

<figure class="half"><div class="post-content-img" style="background-image:url(/images/route/me.jpg);"></div></figure>
<figure class="half"><div class="post-content-img" style="background-image:url(/images/route/lamb.jpg);"></div></figure>

<p>Even writing about it now I’m salivating. The lamb was amazing, it melted in my mouth. I have no clue how they made pulled lamb but they made it well. The tabbouleh was fresh and well balanced. I loved the peach and feta too, the two foods worked well together. It could have done with a few more pomegranate molasses but that is probably because <strong>I LOVE THEM.</strong></p>

<p>Esmee went for the <em>Sweet chilli glazed salmon fillet..</em> It’s served cold so it’s perfect if you want that light, summer lunch vibe. She picked <em>Sweet Potato &amp; Chick Peas with Tahini drizzle</em> and <em>Aubergine Almond Bulgur with Pomegranate Salsa</em>. We swapped half way through (as we like to do that) and again I was very impressed with the quality and flavour of the salads.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It tasted so good, you felt like you were being naughty</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I enjoyed most about the lunch menu was that the salad options were unique, light, fresh, amazing in flavours and textures and but most importantly they were <strong>healthy!</strong> It tasted so good, you felt like you were being naughty. It’s the best type of over-indulging. <strong>FACT.</strong> They’re very considerate of allergens too offering <strong>gluten free,</strong> <strong>nut free</strong> and <strong>dairy free.</strong> options in their salads. I would highly recommend this place if you’re looking for a nice, light lunch that is flavoursome and apetizing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and a wall full of wine. My kinda place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love the decor too. I’m going to describe it as industrial, rustic chic. Dried meat and paprika hanging over the deli counter and a open kitchen so you can see the chefs in action. My fav part was the wall full of wine. It had the quote <em>‘the first kiss and the first glass of wine are the best’</em>. My kind of place.</p>

<p>Sadly, I have changed jobs so I will not be stopping off at Cafe Route anymore for my morning pick me up. But after this visit I will definitely be returning with friends to explore more of the menu. Try it, you won’t regret it!</p>
